# Tastify
Web app that tastefully compares two users' music tastes.

## Description
[Tastify](http://tastify.io) compares two Spotify users' favorite tracks and artists side-by-side. 

### Background
Recently, there has been a rise in Spotify web apps that display a single user's top tracks and artists. Most notable to me is Alex White's Spotify Collage Generator 
(https://www.alexpwhite.me/spotify/collage/).
However, I realized that the best part about these apps came from the experience of sharing and comparing the results with others. 
This led me to develop an app that could make those comparisons in-app.

### Features
Tastify allows a user to share a personalized link which people can use to display their Spotify accounts side-by-side. 
Once shared, users can select between three time ranges and whether they want to display their artists or tracks.
